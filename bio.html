			<h3>About Makaela</h3>
			<br>
			<p>Makaela Victoria Herran is a professional photographer with a Bachelor of Arts in Photography from Utah State University. She currently lives in Salt Lake City, Utah, with her husband Jake. She is often inspired by the beauty of the landscapes in the area and able to take advantage of the amazing geography by rock climbing, ice climbing, camping, and skiing.</p>
			<p>Makaela has been featured in many exhibitions and galleries, and is constantly looking for inspiration and opportunities to build her portfolio and feed her artistic passion.</p>
			<p>She loves gardening, board games, photography and all its implications, and hates milk and water-dwelling creatures. Underwater photography is out of the question. (Not really).</p>
